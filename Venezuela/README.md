Venezuela Analysis
==================

Repository for some random analysis of the Venezuelan political environment. 

Data Sources
------------

* The IMF has some interesting data: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=1980&ey=2014&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&pr1.x=90&pr1.y=7&c=299&s=NGDP_R%2CNGDPD%2CPCPIE%2CLP%2CBCA%2CBCA_NGDPD&grp=0&a=

* The [Venezuelan Institute of National Statistics](http://www.ine.gov.ve/) also has some data, although it does not go back far enough to be as useful as I'd wish. Most of the indicators go back only about a decade or so.
* Polling data made available on the internet.
